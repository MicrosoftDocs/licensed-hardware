# Product Submission and Lifecycle

### Concept Phase
The product approval process starts with all products being entered into the partner portal as concepts.   

Concepts are reviewed by-weekly and feedback is provided back to the partner. We accept concepts for currently approved categories. If you are interested in submitting something net new to the program the review processes may take more time.

### Development Phase
Once the concept is approved it is considered in development. Depending on the type of accessory, new partners may want to submit early prototypes.  Experienced partners may only need to submit final samples for validation

### Validation Phase
Once final samples are received they are reviewed and validated in our own labs.  Depending on the category there may be additional test reports that are required to be sent in from the partner.

During this phase, the following areas are reviewed:

1. Product Validation - Physical review of the products and bench validation based on the specific type of accessory.
1. Brand/Packaging Review - PDFs of packaging are sent in for a brand review.
1. Compliance Declaration Form - Each product submitted needs to have a CDF sent in.

Product Validation includes but is not limited to:

1. Device compatibility
1. Reliability
1. Quality
1. Functionality
1. Regulatory Compliance
1. Ongoing regression testing

### Release Phase
Once all validation steps are complete the product is approved for mass production and distribution. During this time we will also review specific go to market plans and update online listings of licensed products.
