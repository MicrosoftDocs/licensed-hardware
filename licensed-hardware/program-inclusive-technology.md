# Inclusive Technology

Inclusive Technology shows up in a couple of different ways within the Licensed Hardware programs.

## Xbox Adaptive Controller
We oversee and champion the creation of add-ons for the Xbox Adaptive Controller. The [Input Specification](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller-input-device-specification) as well as support forums are available on [Xbox.com](https://xbox.com).

## Assistive Technology for Microsoft Devices
We are interested in discussing a wide range of accessories that would enable more people to use and enjoy Microsoft devices. In most cases, any proposal would be considered part of the **Designed for Xbox** or **Designed for Surface** programs.
